            <li><strong> What is a menstrual cycle?</strong><br>
                It's a monthly hormonal cycle that prepares your body for pregnancy. If no pregnancy occurs, you get your period.
            </li>

            </li>
            <li><strong> What is a normal cycle length?</strong><br>
                Typically 21 to 35 days, but it varies from person to person.
            </li>
            <li><strong> Is it normal to have cramps?</strong><br>
                Yes! Mild to moderate cramps are common and usually caused by the uterus contracting.
            </li>
            <li><strong> Can stress affect my period?</strong><br>
                Definitely. High stress can delay or even skip your period.
            </li>
            <li><strong> What are PMS symptoms?</strong><br>
                Mood swings, bloating, cravings, and fatigue before your period are common PMS symptoms.
            </li>
            <li><strong> Is it okay to exercise during my period?</strong><br>
                Yes, light exercise like walking or yoga can actually help reduce cramps and boost your mood!
            </li>
            <li><strong> Can I swim while on my period?</strong><br>
                Totally! Just use a tampon or menstrual cup.
            </li>
            <li><strong> When should I see a doctor?</strong><br>
                If your period is extremely painful, irregular, or you miss multiple cycles, talk to a doctor.
            </li>
            <li><strong> Can I get pregnant during my period?</strong><br>
                It's rare, but still possible if you have a short cycle. Always use protection if you're not trying to conceive.
